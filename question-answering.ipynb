The  trunk  is  prehensile,\\nbringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects.\\nTusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as\\nweapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large\\near ﬂaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as\\nwell as in communication.
